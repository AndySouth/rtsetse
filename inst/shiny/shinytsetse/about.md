rtsetse is an R package for simulating tsetse fly populations. It was developed by Andy South in 2014-15 for the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.  

rtsetse can be used via this interface or the R command line (and Code tabs in sections 2,4,5 generate code that can be pasted into R to take analyses further). 

**Select tabs to the right on the navigation bar to use**  

rtsetse follows from Hat-Trick, an Excel based Tsetse model developed by Glyn Vale see http://www.tsetse.org

The code is hosted here : https://github.com/AndySouth/rtsetse
