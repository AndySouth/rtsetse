rtsetse is an R package for simulating tsetse fly populations. It was developed by Andy South in 2014-15 for the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.  

rtsetse can be used via this interface or the R command line (and Code tabs in sections 2,4,5 generate code that can be pasted into R to take analyses further). 

**Select tabs to the right on the navigation bar above to use.**
